# reddit-notifier-bot
A bot to notify people on reddit about posts in /r/LoLFanArt (but it can be configured for other subreddits).

## Changes:
* Fixed a bug that caused the bot to crash when encountering a deleted user in either automod.txt or log_file.txt
* Minor tweak to formatting of messages
* Check interval 20 minutes (from 1 minute)
